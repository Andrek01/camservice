## requirements

You only need a python3-Version on your smartVisu-Host. All the needed requirements will be installed by the
installation-script. All files that will be modified will be saved to *.org Files. The needed python-Flask-App
runs in an virtual environment which is build by the installation script.

> ## :information_source: !! Important !!
> The installation-script is only able to setup the service for an installation 
> running the smartvisu on an Apache-Webserver
> 
> Later there will also a script for setting up the service on a NGINX-Server
> and/or hopefully the service is fully integrated in the next release
